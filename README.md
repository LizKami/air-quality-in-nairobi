The project involves analyzing air quality data from Nairobi to build a robust time series model that can predict PM 2.5 (P2) concentrations throughout the day in Nairobi.

**Problem Statement**

Air quality has become a growing concern in many urban areas due to its significant impact on public health and the environment. In cities like Nairobi, the concentration of particulate matter, specifically PM 2.5 (particulate matter less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter), has been identified as a critical pollutant. This project aims to address the challenge of predicting air quality in Nairobi by focusing on PM 2.5 levels, which are known to cause respiratory issues and other health complications.

The project involves analyzing air quality data from Nairobi to build a robust time series model that can predict PM 2.5 (P2) concentrations throughout the day in Nairobi. By accurately forecasting these levels, stakeholders can take proactive measures to mitigate the effects of poor air quality.

Key steps include:

1. Retrieving and querying air quality data from a MongoDB database.
2. Preparing the time series data for analysis, ensuring it is clean and properly formatted.
3. Building an autoregression model to forecast PM 2.5 levels.
4. Enhancing the modelâ€™s performance by fine-tuning its hyperparameters to achieve more accurate predictions.
